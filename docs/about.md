# Giving and Receiving

Share, give, and receive items among friends without transactional exchange.

## What is this?

The world is full of unused products sitting in storages with untapped potential. At the same time, we are always looking for things, and end up buying new items, even when there are perfectly good ones lying around that could be used instead.

To help loosen our dependency on money, break free of the cycle of buying, and move towards a circular sustainable society, this app allows us to freely gift and share items among the people we trust, without any need for financial incentives. It does so by making it easy to display what we own but do not use, and browse items that might be of interest to us that our friends have.

Giving and receiving can be a great source of meaning, connecting us through our items and giving them a personal legacy. I hope this app can help you bring value to your unused products again.
