# One-Sentence Summary

A friend gifting/sharing economy app that lets you give items to each other easily.

# Core Problem

Lots of unused products sitting in our storages. There are friends who might want these products, but there is no way for them to know we have them or would be willing to give it to them. Capitalism makes us by things unnecessrily when we can just gift/share them instead.

# Core Features

- List all your unused products in the app with description, photo, etc
- Connect with your friends in the app
- See all the products that your friends have and are willing to give away with an easy overview
- Mark products as "gifted", but keep them in history (no longer shows up for your friends)
- List products that you NEED/WANT
- see the needs/wants/requests of your friends listed, so that you can consider if you have one

# Additional requirements

- open source
- safe/secure db, you can only see your friends data, not products from strangers
- progressive web app that can be reached on any 

# Future features

- Allow "friends of friends" to see your products
- Product categories and filtering
- Fun unique indie aesthetic
- Allow "trading" or similar based on proximity: if 2 ppl close to eachother have something for the other, they can trade it, even though they are not friends.
- Enable location-based gifting: show your products to anyone nearby
